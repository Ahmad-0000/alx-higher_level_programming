## Description
  In this project, I will start to learn the basics of programming
  in **JavaScript**. JS is a versatile language that is used to
  make websites dynamic, building APIs, bulding games and even
  doing some related *AI* stuff using libraries like **Tensorflos**.

  As a person who aims to be a **Software Engineer**, specialized in
  **back-end** web development, understanding and being comfortable
  with JavaScript is very crucial.
