# Higher Level Programming
## Description
In the first trimester of this program, I mainly focused on
learning to program using **C**. C is considered a low-level
programming language that may be found a little bit hard to
learn and apply in big projects. Programs written in C are
well-known for their excellent **functionaliy**, **speed** and
**portability**, but, as code grows, it will be harder and harder
to maintain, debug and update these programs. Also, C doesn't
contain the leisure of writing **OOP** applications.

In this timester, I will focus mainly on learning to program
in two high level programming languages ,**Python** and **JavaScript**
and mainly on Python, to facilite the wheel of applications
development. I will also consider some other topics, such as
System Administration, Algorithms, Bash and C programming. One
other thing to tell, in this trimester I will do 2 big projects
[**Monty Opcode Interpreter**](https://github.com/Ahmad-0000/monty), the name says it all, and **AirBnB**
in which I will clone a website with the same name.

> [!Note]
> AirBnB project requires knowledge in a variety of topics, such  Networking, Front-end
> Development, Back-end Development, ... etc, thus, it will be divided into small projects.
