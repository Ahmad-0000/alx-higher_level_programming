# Python - ORM
## Description
In this project, I will link two beautiful worlds together,
**Databases** and **Python**. Doing so will result in the ability
to interacte with database systems from inside python scripts
without moving back and forth between the two words.

In this project, I'm going to use **MySQLdb** as a DBAPI and **MySQL**
as a dialect alongside with **SQLAlchemy** as an ORM.
