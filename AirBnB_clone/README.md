# AirBnB Clone - The Console
## Description
Have you ever visited this [website](https://www.airbnb.com/) ?
Whether the answer is yes or no, I'm going to build a clone of it,
make sure to visit it :)

This project will last until the end of this porgram, so that
I will be able to combine all, or most, of what I've learnt so
far, it will be divided into sub-projects:

  * The Console project
  * Web static project
  * MySql project
  * "Web Framework - Templating" project
  * RESTful API project
  * Web Dynamic prject

In each sub-project, a set of concepts will be introduced to
be learnt and applied, so that by the end of this 1 year
program I will be able to build my own websites from scratch
using a set of various technologies.

In this project, I will focus on programming a console to manage
some of the necessary objects with, so that I will increase the
developing process and manipulate a storage system without much
concern of the visual interface.

# Concepts
In this project, I will learn and apply these concepts:
  * Creating Python Packages
  * Using "cmd" Python module
  * Testing (particularly using "unittest" module)
  * Serializng and Desrializng a class into and from JSON format
  * Manipulating date and time using "datetime" Python module
  * Learning how to generate Universal Unique IDs "UUID"
  * Working with \*args and \*\*kwargs
