# SQL introduction
## Description
In the previous project [**"AirBnB_clone"**](https://github.com/Ahmad-0000/AirBnB_clone) I implemented a storage engine
using a .json file to store objects, however, that isn't the right
way to do this. Using files can be very tedious when the data to be
stored gets larger and larger.

The solution is to use a **Database Management System "DBMS"**, which is
a program used to manage databases. There are some types of DBMSs,
but the prominent in the market is the **Relational DBMS "RDBMS"**, in
which data is stored in tables.

In this project, I'm going to practice some fundemantals regarding
**Structerd Query Language "SQL"**, which is the standard language to
work with RDBMSs, and the RDBMS that I will use is "MySQL"
## Compatability
All of the scripts provided are written to be run on **ubuntu 20.04 LTS**
using **MySQL (version 8.0.25)**, so, there may be slight changes needed
to run them correctly
